# Tiered [heavy beta]

Tiered is a Fabric mod inspired by [Quality Tools](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quality-tools). Every tool you make will have a special modifier, as seen below:

There is also a Reforging station added to reroll item attributes:

Tiered was originally made by Draylar, and is being updated and maintained by Andrew6rant.

### Customization

Tiered is almost entirely data-driven, which means you can add, modify, and remove modifiers as you see fit. The base path for modifiers is `data/modid/item_attributes`, and tiered modifiers are stored under the modid of tiered. Here's an example modifier called "Hasteful," which grants additional dig speed when any of the valid tools are held:
```json
{
  "id": "tiered:hasteful",
  "verifiers": [
    { "tag": "c:pickaxes" },
    { "tag": "c:shovels" },
    { "tag": "c:axes" },
    { "tag": "c:hoes" }
  ],
  "style": {
    "color": "white"
  },
  "weight": 8,
  "tooltip_image": [10],
  "tooltip_border":  ["FFFFFFFF"],
  "reforge_cost": 5,
  "attributes": [
    {
      "type": "tiered:generic.dig_speed",
      "modifier": {
        "name": "tiered:hasteful",
        "operation": "MULTIPLY_BASE",
        "amount": 0.10
      },
      "optional_equipment_slots": [
        "MAINHAND",
        "OFFHAND"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Tiered currently provides 3 custom attributes: Dig Speed, Crit Chance, and Size. Dig Speed increases the speed of your block breaking (think: haste), Crit Chance offers an additional random chance to crit when using a tool, and Size changes the held and dropped item rendering.

### Verifiers

A verifier (specified in the "verifiers" array of your modifier json file) defines whether or not a given tag or tool is valid for the modifier. 

A specific item ID can be specified with:

```json

"id": "minecraft:apple"

```

and a tag can be specified with:

```json

"tag": "c:helmets"

```

Tiered provides 6 tags (`c:helmets`, `c:chestplates`, `c:leggings`, `c:boots`, `c:shields`, and `c:fishing_rods`) for your convenience.

### Reforging Cost

Reforging an item's modifier costs experience points (not levels). Each item's cost can be configured individually. The default setup is a Terraria-like system where higher rarities cost more to reforge. Use a value of 0 to make the reforge free, and a negative number to add experience to the player instead of removing it.

### Tooltips

Tiered provides five customization options regarding tooltips.

- `color` changes the text color
- `tooltip_image` specifies the border style (see below)
- `tooltip_border` determines the line colors of the border. It is an array of 0xAARRGGBB hexadecimal formatted strings. Use one value to color the entire border, or two to specify the start and end colors.
- `no_tooltip` can be used in the `name` section of an attribute to prevent it from showing. For example, this can be useful for the `reach` and `attack_range` modifier types, as they are often used together and can clutter a tooltip.

Here is the formatting for the border style. This image allows for up to 16 styles (0-15):

And here is how it looks in-game:

You can use any sized image (with a power of 2 resolution (128x, 256x, 512x, etc, like Vanilla Minecraft) to make as many borders as you like. Here is an example with 64 styles:

![debug-big](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57331134/145140359-26c8014a-dcfc-4fbf-8364-41e7235bcbd9.png)

The border image is stored in an array, to allow for animated borders. Use one value to have a static border, or multiple to animate it (in the frame order specified, with the last index being the framerate in milliseconds).
